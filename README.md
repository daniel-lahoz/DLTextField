# DLTextField

DLTextField is a subclassing of UITextField and UILabel to work with numbers and their formats. I use this subclassing in some projects when a need to work with the format of many fileds and also if i need the reset them to original state.

## Example

You can check the UIViewController on the project to see a very simple demo example.

## Installation

Download the repository and just drag the DLTextField folder to your project.
